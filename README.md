# Memory Game

## Overview
Memory Game is memory challenge game created using React. The game renders 12 flower images. The goal of the game is to click each flower only once. This game utilizes multiple UI components, component state and responds to user events.

## How It Works
* The name of each flower is displayed below the image allowing users to learn the name of each flower as they play.
* One point is earned for each flower clicked. A second click on the same flower will reset the user's score to "0" and start a new game. 
* The placement of images will shuffle in a random order with each click, making the game more challenging.
